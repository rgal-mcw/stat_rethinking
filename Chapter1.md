## Chapter 1: The Golem of Prague

This chapter uses the analogy of alchemical golems to statistical models. They are powerful and obedient, but blind to any nuance that is not instructed to them by their creators.



### 1.1 Statistical Golems

 Typically, people see these powerful golems and don't question them, but often they are flawed. The text refers to many of the classical statistical tests as pre-manufactored golems that are highly applicable in very specific contexts. This is rarely ever the case in science, though.



> "The classical procedures of introductory statistics tends to be inflexible and fragile... This matters, because at the boundaries of most sciences, it is hardly ever clear which procedure is appropriate."



The point of this section is that classical tools are not diverse enough to handle many common research questions. 



> "What researchers need is some unified theory of golem engineering, a set of principles for designing, building, and refining special-purpose statistical procedures."
